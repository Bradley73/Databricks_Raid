    description: >
      Canonical champindex silver spine.
      Inherits all descriptive columns from `stg_champindex__final` and
      attaches a stable `champion_key` via `champion_id_map`.

      This model is the **required upstream dependency** for all downstream
      champindex silver and gold models. Identity resolution occurs here.

    columns:
      - name: champion_key
        description: >
          Canonical, stable identifier for a champion.
          Deterministically derived from champion attributes and used for
          all grouping and joins downstream.

          - not_null

      - name: source_champion_id
        description: >
          Raw champion identifier from the source system.
          Retained in silver for lineage and debugging only.
