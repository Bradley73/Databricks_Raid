  - name: champion_lookup
    description: >
      Canonical champion lookup keyed by champion_key (one row per champion_key).
      Provides stable descriptive attributes for champions (name, rarity, affinity, faction)
      to support joins from keyed champindex facts and downstream gold models.

      This model is populated incrementally from champindex_keyed and is append-only:
      once a champion_key is observed, its attributes are not updated in-place.
